# massey-generator
Generates MATLAB code of the Massey method from user inputted data

The Massey method is a linear least squares numerical method used to generate rankings for players/teams given a data set of past matches. It takes into account match wins and points scored in order calculate these Massey rankings. This page will help create the MATLAB script to run and obtain the rankings. You can read more about the Massey method from a paper I wrote here at https://github.com/philipsdyoo/massey-tf2.

You will copy the code produced to run for yourself. I didn't want to program matrix multiplication and Gaussian elimination partial pivoting, so code is produced instead for you to run.
